# CO₂ Emissions in Africa – Full Data Pipeline Project 🌍

This project involves designing a complete data pipeline to ingest, clean, store, and analyze CO₂ emissions data from various African countries over time. The pipeline demonstrates each stage of the data life cycle and delivers insights into key emission trends, regional disparities, and policy implications.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Apply the full data life cycle from ingestion to analysis
- Develop Python scripts for data cleaning and transformation
- Store and model data using a relational database (e.g. SQLite or MySQL)
- Analyze trends and patterns in emissions data (2000–2020)
- Reflect on data ethics, quality, and transparency in environmental datasets

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (SQLite or MySQL)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- CSV file: `co2 Emission Africa.csv`

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- A small number of countries (like South Africa and Nigeria) have **disproportionately high emissions**, while most African countries have **low carbon footprints**.
- **Total CO₂ emissions increased steadily** from 2000 to 2019, with a dip in 2020 likely due to COVID-19.
- **South Africa** leads in emissions from **energy, electricity, manufacturing**, and **industry**.
- **GDP does not correlate strongly** with per-person emissions across the continent.
- Emissions drivers vary by country: **energy use** (South Africa), **land use change** (Nigeria).

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

- **Target emissions reduction efforts in South Africa and Nigeria** for the highest impact.
- Invest in **renewable energy infrastructure** (solar, wind, hydro) in Southern Africa.
- Address **land use emissions** in Nigeria with **reforestation and agroforestry** policies.
- Support **open-data and monitoring systems** to improve emission tracking and transparency across Africa.

## 🧭 Data Ethics & Considerations

This project considered data ethics at each stage of the analysis:

- During cleaning, we noted that some entries were missing or potentially inconsistent — especially around land-use emissions, which are notoriously difficult to measure. We addressed this where possible, but acknowledge that limitations remain.

- To promote fairness, we analyzed both **total emissions** and **per capita emissions**. This avoids unfairly penalizing high-population countries and helps highlight hidden high-emitters.

- We avoided assuming that wealth equals pollution. Instead of making blanket statements, we explored the **relationship between GDP and emissions per person** and found that other structural factors play a bigger role.

These steps were taken to ensure that our insights were **responsible**, **context-aware**, and **sensitive to real-world complexity**.
